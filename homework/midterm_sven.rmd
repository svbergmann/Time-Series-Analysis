# Part 1

## 1.

I am expecting a somewhat clear upward trend due to the increase in the population.
Also, there could be a seasonal trend, such that the retail sales are higher on special holidays.
Since the Brexit was later than 2007, I am not expecting a big sink somewhere in the graph.

```{r, message = F}
library(TSA)
```
```{r}
data(retail)
plot(retail, xlab = expression("Time"), ylab = expression("Retail sales"), main = expression("Time Series Plot of Retail sales"))
points(retail, pch = as.vector(season(retail)))
```

Seeing the actual graph, I can confirm the upward trend and also a very strong seasonal behaviour.
I clearly expected more holidays to be that present as christmas.
There surely is a really strong seasonal behaviour due to christmas.
This means that the sales are going up starting November each year and reach the peak in December before dropping again.

## 2.

I would try a seasonal ARIMA model, given the upward trend and the potential seasonality.

```{r message = F}
model <- forecast::auto.arima(retail, seasonal = TRUE)
summary(model)
```

### Model type and coefficients

Looking at the summary, we are given an ARIMA model with $p = 1$, $d = 0$, $q = 4$,
where $q$ is the autoregressive order with the coefficient $ar_1 = 0.8469$,
also known as the lag order.
$d$ is the number of differences we take,
which is 0, so that indicates that the data is already stationary.
And $q$ is the order of the moving average process,
where the coefficients are $ma_1 = -0.5939$, $ma_2 = 0.0504$, $ma_3 = 0.0878$, $ma_4 = 0.1742$.
Speaking in a sentence, we have a first order degree autoregressive model with zero order of differencing
and a fourth order moving average model.
That was for the non-seasonal part.
For the seasonal part, we have $p = 0$, $d = 1$, $q = 1$,
where $p$, $d$ and $q$ are exactly as above.
The number 12 in brackets just states the number of seasons (here: months).

### Fit

We have some values to rate the model fit, which are
\begin{align*}
\sigma^2 &= 3.413, \\
\log \text{likelihood} &= -491.04, \\
AIC &= 998.07, \\
AICc &= 998.69, \\
BIC &= 1026.02.
\end{align*}
Here, we can just look at AIC and BIC which suggest a reasonable choice based on model complexity vs fit.
The other values are basically for forecasting reasons.

## 3.

```{r}
res <- ts(rstandard(model), start = c(1986, 1), end = c(2007, 3), frequency = 12)
plot(res, xlab = "Time", ylab = "Residual", main = "Time Series Plot of Residuals")
points(y = res, x = time(res), pch = as.vector(season(res)))
```

The plot of the residuals is kind of displaying the seasonal/periodic behaviour.

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
qqnorm(res, main = "Normal Probability Plot vs \n Residuals Fit")
abline(a = 0, b = 1, col = "red")
hist(res, xlab = "Residual", main = "Histogram of Residuals")
```

The residuals look like they are normally distributed, indicating a good model fit.

```{r}
shapiro.test(res)
```

Since the p-value of the Shapiro-Wilk test is also really low, we can say that they are normally distributed.

```{r}
acf(res, main = "Autocorrelation Plot of Residuals")
```

Since there are just some "spikes" which are not at all big,
the chosen model seems to capture the time-series pretty well.
Also, no value is outside of the confidence interval.

# Part 2

```{r}
data <- as.ts(read.delim(file = "../homework/MidtermPt2.txt", header = TRUE, sep = " "))
plot(data, main = "Original Series")
```
